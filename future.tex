{\color{red}{\chapter{Future Directions} \label{futureIdeas}

This chapter captures ideas and enhancements that may be useful for to consider in future versions of the E-Trace specification.

\section{Code size reduction}

There may be future work needed to track the extension proposed by the code size reduction WG.

\section{Vector}

Now that the vector extension has been ratified it would be interesting to look at extending E-Trace to support instruction and data trace for vector operations.

\section{Inter-instruction cycle counts}

In this mode the encoder will trace where the hart is stalling by
reporting the number of cycles between successive instruction
retirements.

\section{Common control}

When the common control has been completed, this specification should be updated to use that.
